1. Study different sampling mechanisms
2. Check how these sampling mechanisms fare with respect to the ground truth.
   Play around with different metrics to quantify the accuracy of a particular sampling method.
3. Incrementally play with the number of components and compartments in the system.
   Particularly, observe how the sampling method(s) perform for a 3 component system with different interaction matrices.
4. (?) Maximum entropy approach to get rid of "unimportant" params in the system.
