#### Regarding Binodals and Spinodals:
In the spinodal and the binodal computations, laplace pressure becomes important when the molecular volumes of the different components in a system are not equal. To account for a binodal enclosing a spinodal, correct for laplace pressure in numerical solutions.\

#### Regarding multi-component multi-compartment mixtures
The place where the constraints are being imposed controls how the free energy landscape would look like. 

Essentially, find the "optimum place" to impose the constraint in the system.
