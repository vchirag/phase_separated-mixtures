Basic administrative stuff and project proposal.

(Relevant) MoM of the proposal discussion:
1. Compartmentalized study of phase mixtures. Start with 2 components and deduce the binodal and spinodal lines.
2. Study $\chi-\phi$ plots by sampling the actual states and arriving at the Boltzmann Distribution of the system. (What does this even mean?)
   Describe a state (size, composition) of the phase and distinguish 1 phase from the other according to the concentration difference. (???)
3. $\exists$ 3 approaches to discuss droplet behaviour:
	1. Particle-based -> really expensive to numerically study
	2. (Coarse-Graining) Concentration-based -> Uses the free energy functional $F[\phi]$.
	3. (Another layer of Coarse-Graining) Effective Droplet Model -> Assuming homogeneity (forgot where?)
4. Compressibility can change the behaviour and adds atleast 1 more degree of freedom in the system.

Terms to look out for:
1. Flory-Huggins Free Energy
2. Gibbs' Phase Rule
3. Effective Droplet model
