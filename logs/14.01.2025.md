Insights:

- Compartments: Any region in the configuration space which has the same composition throughout.
	- \# Compartments $\geq$  \# Phases because of Gibbs Phase Rule.
- Droplet growth could occur either through Oswald Ripening or coalescence (difference in the Laplace pressure). However, we wouldn't be concerned with the time dynamics in this project.
- There's a different **Flory-Huggins Free Energy (FHFE)** (functional) for compartmentalized system with compartment size(s) as (a) degree of freedom.
	- The FHFE for a multi-component system with concentrations $\phi_i, \, \forall\, i\, \in \{1, \dots, N_c\},$ is $F_\text{FH}^{\text{multi}} = \sum_i^{N_c}\phi_i \ln\phi_i - \sum_{ij}^{N_c}\chi_{ij}\phi_i\phi_j$    
	- However, with the size parameter $\eta^\alpha,\, \forall \,\alpha \in \{\text{compartments}\}$:
	  $F_\text{system} = \sum_\alpha^{\text{compartments}}\eta_\alpha F^{\alpha,\,\text{multi}}_{FH}$
	  where $F^{\alpha,\,\text{multi}}_{FH}$ is the FHFE for multi-component compartment $\alpha$.

#### Basic Protocol (2 component, 2 compartment):
**Layer of abstraction**: The sizes represent compartments here.

**Aim**: To find the likelihood of a given multi-component compartmentalized system to phase separate, provided we only know the composition of only one component, say $\phi_A$.
1. Fix $\phi_A^{\text{global}}$-> this is the total concentration of $\phi_A$ in the system.
   $\implies \phi_B^{\text{global}} = 1 - \phi_A^{\text{global}}$ -> $\exists$ only 1 degree of freedom with respect to the concentrations/compositions.
   
   Meanwhile, in the compartment $\alpha$:
   $\phi_A^\alpha \in [0, 1]$ and $\phi_B^\alpha = 1 - \phi_A^{\alpha}$.  
   
   The size of the compartment $\eta \in [0, 1]$ where the extremities signify a homogeneous phase.

2. Constraints:
	- $\forall \alpha: \phi_A^{\alpha} + \phi_B^{\alpha} = 1$
	- $\eta \phi_A^{\alpha} + (1-\eta)\phi_A^{1-\alpha} = \phi_A^{\text{global}}$
	  
	This would give a possible $\phi-\eta$ configuration space.
	
3. Discretize this $\phi-\eta$ space and compute $F(\phi, \eta)$ foe each of the points.
4. Find $\arg \min_{\phi, \eta} F(\phi, \eta)$
